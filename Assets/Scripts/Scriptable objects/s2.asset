  scenarioHeadlineText: Community shelter 2
  scenarioDialogueText: 'The rate of homelessness is increasing more than ever before
    we need to respond to this somehow even if there is an opportunity for the homeless
    to at least have a decent sleep in a warm home.

    I want to build a community
    shelter for these victims of society and would appreciate if you would consider
    funding.


    would cost around $$$$


    but the return would be opportunity
    to those less fortunate 2222'
